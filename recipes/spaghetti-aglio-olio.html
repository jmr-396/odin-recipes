            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the spaghetti to a saucepan of salted boiling water & cook for 2 minutes less than the minimum time on the packet (Note: You can taste the spaghetti as it cooks to ensure it is salted to your preference)
                <li>Add the garlic with the olive oil & chilli flakes to a cold saucepan</li>
                <li>Cook the garlic on low heat until it starts to brown</li>
                <li>Once the garlic begins to brown, add a ladle of pasta water & increase the heat</li>
                <li>Once the pasta is ready, transfer it to the saucepan with the oil (do not discard the pasta water yet)</li>
                <li>Add another ladle of pasta water in the saucepan & stir continuously. A creamy sauce will form.</li> 
                <li>Cook the pasta for another 2 minutes. Add more pasta water as needed - we want any excess water to evaporate by the time the pasta is cooked and al dente</li>
                <li>Once cooked, turn off the heat. Add & mix the parsley into the pasta</li>
                <li>It's ready. Serve up your delicious Spaghetti Aglio e Olio & Enjoy!</li>
